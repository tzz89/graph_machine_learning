# Graph Machine Learning

## <u>Feature Engineering</u>
1. Creating Graph Features
2. Label purification

## <u>Model Training</u>
Model training section will be task based. For each task, there will be subsections on 
1. Dataset preparation (Train/Test/Eval)
2. Dataloading (MiniBatches)
3. Model Architecture, Loss function and metric
4. Training Loop
5. Experiment tracking and training monitoring
6. Distributed Training
7. Explainability

## <u>Deployment</u>
1. Serializing Model
2. Deployment on inference server

## Monitoring
1. Explainabilty
2. Prediction/Feature drift
3. Embedding Quality

## Real Time inference
1. Graph DB
2. Vector Store
3. Feature Store

## Real world applications examples
